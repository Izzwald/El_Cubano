This is a website made for the final first semester project for Computer Software Engineering Technology at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology.
https://www.stevenscollege.edu/academics/associate-degrees/computer-software-engineering/. 
We designed this in an attempt to create a better functioning website for one of our favorite places to stop before and after class; El Cubano Resturant. 
We in no way take ownership of the images or information on the page. 
All images and information belong to the original website "https://elcubanorestaurantpa.com/".
